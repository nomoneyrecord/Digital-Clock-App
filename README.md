##Summary

This app was the first experience I’ve had with utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This taught me a lot about utilizing functions, values, parameters, methods, and gaining a better understanding about JavaScript as an object orientated and verbose language for functionality. Ran into a lot of concepts with JavaScript that I couldn’t grasp until I kept experimenting with multiple techniques and eventually catching on to the syntax and structure of the language. It was very exciting once I started to see the results of my work and finalizing the deliverables of the application. I also utilized Chat GPT to give me a code recommendation to get the background to shift colors. I don’t fully understand the CSS of this result but it introduced me to some new commands for styling.
